    style.css - Custom styles for the Make Money Online Landing Page.
    This file is primarily used for importing fonts and defining custom keyframe animations
    that are then applied via Tailwind CSS classes in index.html.
*/

/* Import Google Fonts - Inter is used as the primary font */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700;800&display=swap');

/* Apply a smooth scroll behavior for better user experience */
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;

/* Base body styles (font family is also defined in Tailwind config for consistency) */
body {
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    /* Prevent horizontal scrolling on smaller screens due to responsive layouts */
    overflow-x: hidden;
}

/* Custom CSS for Notification Popups */
/* While animations are defined in Tailwind config's keyframes,
   this provides a fallback or can be used for direct application
   if needed, though Tailwind's animation utility classes are preferred. */

/* Basic styling for the notification popups.
   The animation properties are applied via Tailwind classes directly in HTML. */
.notification {
    /* Initial state for slide-in animation, though Tailwind's `opacity-0` and `animate-slideIn` handle this */
    transform: translateX(100%);
    opacity: 0;
    /* Ensure smooth transitions for any non-animated properties */
    transition: all 0.5s ease-out;
}

/*
    Note: The actual animation keyframes (slideIn, slideOut, fadeIn) are defined
    within the <script> tag in index.html inside the `tailwind.config` block.
    This allows them to be directly consumed by Tailwind's `animate-{name}` classes.
    If they were solely in this CSS file, they would need explicit class applications
    or JavaScript manipulation to apply/remove them. Sticking to Tailwind's
    animation utilities for cleaner HTML.
